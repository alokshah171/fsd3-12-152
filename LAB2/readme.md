# EventLoop

 JS is synchronuous  and single threaded bydefault 
 ## There can be async behaviour
 -- with BrowerAPI --setTime, setInterval, setImmediate, nextTick

 --with promise

 --with event handlers

 --a function is not excuted immediatly but it must be excuted by run, it have some status
 at minor it may reslove 
## Call back
 --Call back function => that pass as argument or the paramenter to another function

 ## modern js is divided into 2  catogories 
 -- 1. common js ( .cjs) -> support oops -> require
       - priority ( nexTick, promise , setimmediate/setTimeout)
 -- 2. module js ( .mjs) -> follow modular approach -> import
       - priority (promise ,nextick ,setimmediate/setTimeout)
